# Kickstarting with Excel

This is the first weekly challenge of the Bootcamp. I am still a bit shaky on Git as I couldn't give much time to it. Planning to get things sorted out this weekend. Let's start. 

## Overview of Project

This project is aimed at identifying the impact of the launch date and goals on the outcome (successful, failed or cancelled) of a Kickstarter project. 

### Purpose

The purpose is the identify the time, especially the time of year and the optimum goal to achieve a higher success rate in Kickstarter projects.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Based on the data it can be inferred that for theatre projects, summer is the best time when people can go out, especially during the months of April to August. The peak is in May and it gradually slows down from then onwards till September. Cancelled projects seem to maintain a steady pattern throughout the year. Failed attempts at theatre projects are also somewhat steady and follow similar patterns to successful projects. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Projects with lower goals pledged seems to have a higher success rate than projects with higher goals pledged. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Nothing with Excel but mostly with GitHub.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
> May is the best month to reach out to people for projects
> Success and failure of projects are somewhat correlated with the time they are pledged.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
> Lower pledged amount has more probability of success
> Goals of 1000 to 4999 had the highest number of projects

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
> Data needs to be extrapolated and reformatted. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
> Country based success, failure, cancellation rate/percentage
> Average pledged by backers based on country to find out where the backers are spending more money on different categories
